- **Be careful when purchasing hacking cheats to avoid scams. More projects to come.**

- **We utilized TSearch (or Cheat Engine) to identify the address containing the remaining bomb count. With Ollydbg, we set a write breakpoint at that address to trace the writing process, which led us to the discovery of the CGame class. By feeding the CGame address into ReClass, we explored various offsets and assigned them more descriptive names. This process allowed us to generate a C++ class, as demonstrated in "CGame.h". Once our class was established, we integrated it into our DLL (using the F5 hotkey in this scenario), enabling us to inject it into the game and employ it as needed.**

This project is intended solely for educational purposes. As the creator, I want to emphasize that I do not bear any responsibility for any potential harm or unlawful activities that may arise. My primary objective in undertaking this project was to deepen my understanding of reverse engineering, with no intention to disrupt the gaming experience for fellow enthusiasts. It's important to note that I won't be providing ongoing updates to the offsets due to these reasons. Please understand that the following code may not mirror the exact version used in my hackathon.
